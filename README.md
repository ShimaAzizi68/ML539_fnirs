# Project repoistory for CS539 - Machine Learning 

## Developed by Team 3 - Jocelyn Petitto, Shima Azizi, Kathleen Cachel, Amisha Jindal, and Alicia Howell

### Environment requirements
To run each algorithm's script, you must have the following packages: sklearn, sktime, statistics, numpy, pandas, time, sys, json, datetime, os, csv.

### General notes
Each algorithm was implemented in its own script, so there are differences in the methods to run each algorithm. Please be sure to read the algorithm's section in the README.md to understand how to use it.

There are four data files, but only three datasets. **eeg_small_uci.csv** is the small UCI EEG dataset and is used individually. **211_AXCPT19_TK_axcaxwr_hb_cs539.csv** is the WPI fNIRS dataset and is used individually. **eeg_test_uci.csv** and **eeg_train_uci.csv** belong to the large UCI EEG dataset and are run together. **eeg_test_uci.csv** is the designated testing data from the original researchers who collected the data, and **eeg_train_uci.csv** is the designated training data. They contain approximately equal amounts of data. 

### Time Series Forest Classifier (TSF)
instructions to run TSF

### MrSEQL
The code is in the form of a notebook and has different cells for the three experiments, given by their titles. In order to run a particular case, just uncomment the particular cell and comment the other cells.
